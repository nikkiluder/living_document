# Authoring with Quarto

## Anatomy of a Quarto Report
<!-- TODOs: metadata header, sections, layout options, customization -->

### Metadata Header
The *metadata header* is the beginning of a Quarto document. It displays information like author or date and tells Quarto how the document should be configurated. As an example, you can look at the top of this document in the in its qmd file version, *not in the rendered version*.
There are a lot of possibilities to customize a Quarto document in the *metadata header*. In this document, we will be looking at the most commonly used configurations. If you want to see all the options that are available, you can visit the [official Quarto website] (https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html).

The formatting applies only to the current document.

Use triple dashes to delineate the block:

```
---
some metadata
---
```
Most commonly, the title block contains the **title**, **subtitle**, **authors**, **date**, **doi** and the **abstract** of the article.

Other important options:

```
format: html / pdf / docx
```
This option defines the format of the final product.

```
date: YYYY-MM-DD
```
Sets the publication date (find supported date formats [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/dates.html)
)

```
execute: 
  echo: true / false
  eval: true / false
  warning: true / false ...
```
Controls how code cells are executed:

- **echo**: shows the code in the output if **true**
- **eval**: executes the code if **true**
- **warning**: includes warnings in the output if **true**
- **message**: includes messages from code if **true**
- **error**: displays error messages in the output if **true**

### Sections
To better structure and improve the appearance of the document, a Quarto report can be divided into sections with headings.
If you want to number the headings or add a table of contents *toc*, which serves as an interactive section menu, you can do so in the *metadata header*. For example, in this document, we use the following configurations:
```markdown  
  toc: true
  toc-depth: 3
  number-sections: true
```
You can also add the option `number-depth: 4` to set the deepest level of heading that should be numbered and you can use `### Example Heading {.unnumbered}` to exclude a heading from numbering.

## Document Sections and Header Levels

In Quarto (and Markdown), section headers are defined using the hash symbol `#`. The number of hash symbols indicates the depth of the section:

- `#` creates a top-level (H1) section
- `##` creates a second-level (H2) subsection
- `###` creates a third-level (H3) sub-subsection  
  … and so on, up to six levels (`######`)

This system allows the document to be structured hierarchically, which improves both **readability** and **navigability**. Header levels are also used to build features like the **table of contents** (`toc: true`) and for **numbering sections** (`number-sections: true` in YAML).

Always include a space after the hash symbols. For example:

```markdown
# Introduction
## Methodology
### Data Collection
#### Survey Design
##### Question Format
###### Notes
```

To ensure consistency, avoid skipping levels (e.g., going directly from `#` to `###`) unless intentionally needed for visual clarity or document structure.

For more, see [Quarto documentation on headers](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#headers).

### Layout Options
Depending on what format you use, there are different layout options available.
For a **HTML document**, like this one, there are the following options to configurate the document:

#### Page Layout
1. `page-layout: article` - default layout with single centered content column
2. `page-layout: full` - expanding content to full browser width
3. `page-layout: sidebar` - adding sidebar for navigation

#### Themes
There are 25 themes from [*Bootswatch*] (https://bootswatch.com/) available in Quarto. These themes can further be customized in the metadata header.
If you want to check out all the theme options and configurations, you can go to [Quarto - HTML themes] (https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html).

#### Table of Contents
If you set `toc: true` in the metadata header, Quarto creates a table of contents. This table can further be configurated with options such as:
`toc-depth: 4` - specify number of section/heading levels to include in the toc, *default is set to 3*
`toc-expand: 3` - specify how much of toc to show initially, *default is set to 1*
`toc-title: Example` - customize title of toc
`### Example Heading {.unnumbered .unlisted}` - exclude heading from toc
`toc-location: left` - set location of toc
For more information, you can visit [Quarto - HTML basics] https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html and scroll to the section **Table of Contents**.

#### Other Layout Options
There are many other layout options available to configurate spacing, typography, character width, etc.
For all the options you can visit [Quarto - HTML basics] https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html.

## Basic Formatting & Markdown
<!-- TODOs: headings, lists, emphasis, code blocks, links, footnotes -->
### Lists
#### Unordered Lists

1. Use `-`, `+`, or `*` followed by a space (choosing one style is enough)
2. To create a **nested list**, indent (with 2 or 4 spaces) the sublist items under the parent item

**Example**

```markdown
* unordered list
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
        - sub-sub-item 1
```
**Rendered as**

* unordered list
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2
        - sub-sub-item 1

#### Ordered Lists
1. Ordered lists work just like unordered lists — just replace the bullets (`-`, `+`, or `*`) followed by a period `.`

2. In a nested ordered list, formats like `A.` or `i)`can be recognized if they are properly indented
    - Note: it's also better to use **two spaces after the marker** to ensure the item is parsed as part of the list

**Example**
```markdown
1. ordered list
2. item 2
    i) sub-item 1
         A.  sub-sub-item 1
```
**Rendered as**

1. ordered list
2. item 2
    i) sub-item 1
         A.  sub-sub-item 1

#### Mix Ordered and Unordered lists
It's also possible to mix ordered and unordered lists.

**Example**

```markdown
1. Main item one  
   - Sub item A  
   - Sub item B  
2. Main item two  
   * Sub item C  
     1. Sub-sub item (ordered)  
     2. Another sub-sub item  
```

**Rendered as**

1. Main item one  
   - Sub item A  
   - Sub item B  
2. Main item two  
   * Sub item C  
     1. Sub-sub item (ordered)  
     2. Another sub-sub item  

*For more formatting options, see the [Quarto Markdown Basics documentation on Lists](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html#lists).*

### Emphasis and Text Styles

In Markdown and Quarto, text formatting is done by surrounding words or phrases with special symbols. This method makes formatting quick, consistent, and readable even in plain text. It also helps writers focus on content without relying on visual formatting tools.

The most common symbols are asterisks `*` and tildes `~`. These symbols are placed directly before and after the text that should be formatted.

#### Bold

Bold text is created by placing double asterisks around a word or phrase.

```markdown
**This text is bold**
```

**This text is bold**

#### Italic

Italic text is created by placing single asterisks around the text. Italic can be used for emphasis, thoughts, or non-English terms.

```markdown
*This text is italic*
```

*This text is italic*

#### Strikethrough

Strikethrough text is created using double tildes. This format is useful for marking deletions or outdated information.

```markdown
~~This text is crossed out~~
```

~~This text is crossed out~~

#### Combining Styles

It is also possible to combine multiple formatting styles. For example:

```markdown
***bold and italic***
```

***bold and italic***

```markdown
**~~bold and strikethrough~~**
```

**~~bold and strikethrough~~**

```markdown
*~~italic and strikethrough~~*
```

*~~italic and strikethrough~~*

When combining symbols, the order matters: the outermost symbols should match (for example, `**~~text~~**` is correct, while `*~text~*` is not).  
Also make sure all opening symbols are properly closed — otherwise, the formatting might not render as expected.

These combinations allow flexibility in tone:  
- Use `***text***` when something is **important and personal**  
- Use `**~~text~~**` when something was once important but is now removed  
- Use `*~~text~~*` when marking a tentative or soft correction
 
For more formatting options, see the [Quarto Markdown Basics documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

### Inserting External Links

External links can be added verbatim by copying said link into the document and bracketing it with < > like this: 

```markdown
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee>
```

If one does not want the link to appear in full, one can add another string in square brackets and the link, this time in regular brackets, to the right as exemplified below. The output will then display the link in the square brackets and clickin on it will redirect the reader to the landing page of the deposited link - here a page on [Bumblebees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee).

```markdown
[Bumblebees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bumblebee)
```

### Linking to Document-Internal Sections

For this, the header one wishes to link to must be augmented with a tag of the following syntax (including the squiggly brackets). The NAME part can be adapted by the author. The tag is added to the header's right boundary.

```markdown
{#sec-NAME}
```
To later reference said header, the same tag but with an at sign instead of the octothorpe must be added. This can then be integrated into prose text. The NAME part will be displayed.

```markdown
As discussed in @sec-NAME,...
```

## Code Cells and Quarto Options
<!-- TODOs: basic chunk, inline code, echo, chunk options -->

## Images and Plots
<!-- TODOs: inserting local images, captions, figure sizing, code-generated plots -->

Use the following syntax to insert your local image:

```![Stepan](images/cat.PNG)```

![Stepan](images/cat.PNG)

Where the text enclosed in square brackets is the caption.

By default, figures are displayed in their original size. You can change the size by passing custom width or height in curly brackets:

```![Stepan](images/cat.PNG){width=20%}```

![Stepan](images/cat.PNG){width=20%}

Width and height can be specified using a **percentage**, **inches** or **millimetres**.

You can control figure alignment with the **fig-align** attribute:

```![Stepan](images/cat.PNG){width=20% fig-align="right"}```

![Stepan](images/cat.PNG){width=20% fig-align="right"}

The other options are **default**, **left** and **right**.

You can also add alternative text which will be displayed if your picture is not loaded:

```![Stepan](){fig-alt="A frustrated cat."}```

![Stepan](images/cats.PNG){fig-alt="A frustrated cat."}

You can render the caption as alternative text by adding a backslash at the end:

```![Stepan](images/cat.PNG)\```

![Stepan](images/cats.PNG)\

### How to reference images in text

You can reference your figures by adding an ID with the **fig-** prefix and then referencing them with the **@** prefix in text:

```![Stepan](images/cat.PNG){width=20% #fig-cat}```

![Stepan](images/cat.PNG){width=20% #fig-cat}

Please observe the frustrated cat in @fig-cat.

See the [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html) for further details.


## Tables
<!-- TODOs: markdown tables, knitr::kable(), comparison -->
### Quarto Markdown Table

**Markdown Source and Display**

```` markdown
| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

: Demonstration of pipe table syntax {#tbl-syntax .striped .hover}
````

| Default | Left | Right | Center |
|---------|:-----|------:|:------:|
| 12      | 12   |    12 |   12   |
| 123     | 123  |   123 |  123   |
| 1       | 1    |     1 |   1    |

: Demonstration of pipe table syntax {#tbl-syntax .striped .hover}



-   **Basic syntax**
    -   Pipe tables use `|` to indicate column boundary, at least three dashes `---` to define the header row and a line starting with `:` after the table to add a caption.
-   **A header row is required**
    -   You can simulate a "headerless" table by using an empty header (e.g., `| | |`).
-   **Leading and trailing pipes `|` are optional but pipes between all columns are necessary**
    -   Example: `fruit|price` is valid.
-   **Alignment in source code is just for readability**
    -   Pipe characters need not to be vertically aligned. Uneven tables still render correctly.
-   **Alignment type is set using colons `:` in the separator line**
    -   Three alignment types are shown above: *Left (Default)*; *Right*; *Center*.
-   **Relative column widths can be influenced by the number of dashes `---` in the separator line**
    -   More dashes = wider column.
    -   Example: `------|---` will make the first column approximately 2/3 width, the second 1/3.
      - Alternative: `: Table Caption {tbl-colwidths="[67,33]"}`
-   **Block elements are not allowed in table cells**
    -   No paragraphs, lists, or multi-line content inside a cell.
- **Add the Bootstrap classes after the table caption**
  - Example: `:Table Caption {.hover .striped}`
- **Cross-reference with `:Table Caption {#tbl-label}` and `@tbl-label`**
  - Example: See `@tbl-syntax` -> See @tbl-syntax
  
*For more details, see the [Quarto documentation on tables](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html).*



### Creating Tables Programmatically with knitr::kable()

`knitr::kable()` is a R function used to format data frames or matrices as clean, publication-ready tables in Markdown, HTML, or LaTeX outputs.

**Syntax**

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
kable(x, format, digits = getOption("digits"), row.names = NA,
      col.names = NA, align, caption = opts_current$get("tab.cap"),
      label = NULL, format.args = list(), escape = TRUE, ...)
```

| Argument       | Type                 | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `x`            | data.frame / matrix  | The data to be rendered as a table. Required.                             |
| `format`       | character            | Output format: `"markdown"`, `"html"`, `"latex"`, etc. Usually auto-detected. |
| `digits`       | integer              | Number of decimal places to display. Defaults to `getOption("digits")`.     |
| `row.names`    | logical / `NA`       | Whether to include row names: `TRUE`, `FALSE`, or `NA` for auto-detect.     |
| `col.names`    | character vector     | Custom column names for the table.                                          |
| `align`        | character vector     | Column alignment: `"l"` (left), `"c"` (center), `"r"` (right).              |
| `caption`      | character            | Table caption shown above the table.                                        |
| `label`        | character            | Label used for cross-referencing (e.g., `@tbl-summary`).                    |
| `format.args`  | list                 | Additional arguments passed to `format()`.                                  |
| `escape`       | logical              | Escape special characters like `_`, `&`. Use `FALSE` to allow raw HTML/LaTeX. |
| `...`          | —                    | Additional arguments passed to formatting methods.                          |

**Example**

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
# Create a data frame similar in structure to the markdown example
data <- data.frame(
  Default = c("12", "123", "1"),
  Left = c("12", "123", "1"),
  Right = c("12", "123", "1"),
  Center = c("12", "123", "1")
)
# Generate the table using knitr::kable()
# Set column alignment: left, left, right, and center
# Add a caption to the table
kable(
  data,
  align = c("l", "l", "r", "c"),
  caption = "Table 1. Demonstration of knitr::kable() table with alignment"
)
```


*For more details on using `knitr::kable()`, see the [R Markdown Cookbook – Section 6.5](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).*

## Citations and Bibliography
<!-- TODOs: .bib file usage, citation styles, Zotero integration -->

---

## Citations and Bibliography

Citations in Quarto are managed using external bibliography files, typically with a `.bib` extension (in BibTeX format). This method keeps references organized and separates citation data from the main text.

### Step 1: Create a `.bib` file

A `.bib` file contains citation entries such as `@book`, `@article`, or `@misc`. Each entry stores metadata like author, title, and year. This format allows Quarto to format and render citations consistently.

Example entry:

```bibtex
@book{manning1999,
  author    = {Christopher D. Manning and Hinrich Schütze},
  title     = {Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing},
  year      = {1999},
  publisher = {MIT Press}
}
```

It is recommended to name the file `references.bib` and place it in the root of the Quarto project folder.

Tip: Tools like Zotero (with the Better BibTeX plugin) can help manage and export `.bib` files easily.

### Step 2: Link the `.bib` file in the YAML header

Add the following line to the YAML metadata block at the top of the `.qmd` file:

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
```

We can also include multiple `.bib` files if needed:

```yaml
bibliography: [references.bib, extra.bib]
```

This tells Quarto where to find the citation data.

### Step 3: Add inline citations

To cite a source in the text, use `@key`, where `key` is the BibTeX ID from your `.bib` file.

There are two common ways to format inline citations:

- `[@manning1999]` → renders as: (Manning and Schütze 1999)  
  *Used when the author name should appear in the citation.*

- `[-@manning1999]` → renders as: (1999)  
  *Used when the author name is already mentioned in the sentence.*

For example:

See [@manning1999]. 
Published in [-@manning1999].

### Step 4: Generate the bibliography section

At the end of document, include a section where the bibliography will be rendered:

```markdown
## References
```

Quarto will automatically generate this list using the sources you've cited. If no references section is added manually, it will appear at the end of the document by default.

### Step 5: Change the citation style (Optional)

Citation styles can be changed using the `csl:` option in the YAML block. For example:

```yaml
csl: apa.csl
```

CSL (Citation Style Language) files define formatting rules (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago). Thousands of styles can be downloaded from the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

# Git and Collaborative Workflows

## Branching and Merge Requests
<!-- TODOs: branch creation, MR checklists, communication -->

## GitHub Desktop
<!-- TODOs: clone, commit, push, sync conflicts -->


### Adding a Branch to GitHub Desktop

Branches can only be added to repositories that are already connected to GitHub Desktop. Thus, make sure
that you have cloned and/or forked the project from GitHub online. Furthermore, it goes without saying that one must be logged in to GitHub Desktop. Then, proceed as follows:

Navigate to the according repository by:

1. In GitHub Desktop, navigate to the drop-down "Current repository" in the top left corner as shown in the image below (1.)
2. In said drop-down, select the repository you want to create the new branch for from the list of available repositories shown under 2. in the image below.

![ ](images/GitHubDesktop-BranchWorkflow-1.jpg){width=80%}

Then, create a new branch by:

3. navigating to the drop-down "Current branch", which you'll find right to the "Current repository" drop-down at the top of the window as shown in 3. in the left image below.
4. Inside the drop-down "Current branch" (at the top) you'll find two tabs: "Branches" and "Pull requests" (see 4. in left image below).
5. In the tab "Branches", click on the "New branch" button next to the search box/Filter as showcased in 5. in the left image below.
6. You will be asked to enter a name for your branch in a popup window as shown in the right image below  - do so in the field indicated as 6. in the right image below. For this, you can only use letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, and periods. Additionally, the branch name cannot start with a period or end with a slash. In the same pop-up, you'll have to decide whether you want your new branch to be added on to an already existing branch or to the main (see 7. in the right image below). Pick the option suitable to you. 
7. Hit "Create branch" (8., right image) at the bottom right of the pop-up.

You can now access your new branch via the "Current branch" drop-down at the top.

### Sync Local Repository on GitHub Desktop with Remote Repository


NB: To synchronize the local repository through GitHub Desktop with its remote counterpart in the first place, said repository must already be imported into GitHub Desktop. If this is the case, proceed as follows to sync.

1. In GitHub Desktop, navigate to the repository you wish to sync using the drop-down at the top left corner. For this, open the drop-down (1. in left image below) and select the according repository (as in 2).
2. As shown in the right image below, you have the option to select a specific branch you would like to sync. You'll find this in the drop-down indicated in 3, under "Branches" (4) and can select the according branch in the area marked by 5.

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![ ](images/git_sync_workflows-1.jpg)

![ ](images/git_sync_workflows-2.jpg)

:::

Synchronisation can then be inbound or outbound, meaning you can import the newest version including changes made by others or you can add your changes (or request for them to be added) to the remote project. Either way, proceed as follows:

3. Navigate to the drop-down/button right of "Current branch" (labelled 6 in the below image). GitHub Desktop will recognize if you have any changes to share, in which case the button will read "Publish branch" (if you've opened a branch that's not yet part in remote) or "Push to origin" (if you've commited changes to an already shared branch). This will integrate your changes (or ask for them to be integrated) into the remote project. In case you would just like to obtain the newest version of the remote document, navigate to the drop-down option labelled as 7 in the image below and press "Fetch from origin". You will then have the latest version of the remote project on your local GitHub Desktop. 
In case you have no commits/changes to publish, the button will only read "Fetch from origin" in the first place and the "Push to origin" or "Publish branch" option will not even show up.

In case you just Pushed a commit, you can now also open a pull request.

# Project Organization

## Project Structure

Use the following basic template for your project

```md
project_name/              # <1>
├── data/                # <2>
├── R/                   # <3>
├── outputs/             # <4>
│   ├── images/
│   ├── tables/
│   └── .../
├── .gitignore           # <5>
├── _quarto.yml          # <6>
├── report.qmd           # <7>
├── worklog.md           # <8>
├── README.md            # <9>
└── project_name.Rproj   # <10>
```
1. Project name
2. Original data used by your project
3. R scripts for functions and utilities, as well as setup code
4. All outputs are stored here, with nested folders for images, data, etc. as needed
5. Git ignore list (configured to skip temporary files)
6. Quarto configuration file — defines output format, theme, and other global settings
7. The main project report (Quarto Markdown)
8. Worklog tracking project member contributions
9. Project description and instructions
10. RStudio Project file (if using)

## General Guidelines

- Use RStudio Projects (or similar tool) to organize your project
- Use GitHub issues, branches, and structured communication channels to organize your work
  - Establish project roles and responsibilities
  - Maintain the worklog to track your contributions
  - Have one `main` branch to represent the latest "clean" work you did
  - Use a single meta-issue to track project progress
- Use descriptive, consistent file names
  - Use `snake_case`, avoid spaces or other special characters in file names
  - Use numerical prefixes (e.g. `01_load_data.R`, `02_clean_data.R`) if scripts need to be executed in particular order
  - Use `.gitignore` to exclude temporary files that do not need to be versioned
  - Add `.Rhistory`, `.Rproj.user`, and large intermediate results (e.g. model caches) to `.gitignore`
- Organize your code
  - Prefer short, focused chunks with clear purpose
  - Put large analyses and common utilities into separate scripts (to be stored in `R/`)
- Never modify raw data files directly
  - Use spatial separation for generated files (i.e. `outputs/`)
- Document everything
  - Create a detailed README with project overview, dependencies, and instructions
  - Comment your code thoroughly
  - Document data sources (version, license, how the data was fetched, etc.)
  - Include a data dictionary (brief structured explanation of all data you use)
  - Document decisions and assumptions
- Aim for reproducibility
  - Document the packages you use (and how you use them)
  - Always use project-relative file paths (e.g. `data/data.csv` instead of `/Users/taras/Projects/my_project/data`)
  - Make sure that the code runs on all your machines

# Coding Style Guide

Good coding style makes your code easier to read, share, and revisit later. The goal is clarity and consistency. This section outlines some simple style rules to follow in our group projects.

## Coding Style

**Structure**

- Use **two-space indentation** — this keeps things compact and readable
- Use the **pipe operator (`|>`)** to break operations into clear steps
- Every **dplyr predicate** (like `filter()`, `mutate()`) should start on a **new line**.
- For long function calls, put each argument on a separate line, with indentation.

**Variables**

- All names should be self-explanatory, be as verbose as necessary (e.g. `penguins_stats_summary` instead of `pgs`)
- Use **snake_case** for all variable and function names (e.g., `penguin_data`, `filter_species()`)
- Use different variable names for different data

**Code Chunks**

- Chunks should be compact and focused — ideally under 10–15 lines
- Avoid “dead code” — don’t include code that isn’t used or explained
- Large, reusable functions or repeated logic should be outsourced to a shared script (e.g., `R/helpers.R`)
- Every chunk should fulfill a clear purpose, and its role should be obvious from the context or accompanying comments

**Comments**

- Use comments to explain why something is being done — not just what
- Avoid repeating the code in your comment
- Place comments above or beside logical steps to improve clarity
- Use comment markers (e.g. `# TODO: `, `# CHECK: `) to call attention to things that need to be done

## Example

```r
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
# survey Adelie penguins across the islands                            # <1>
# note: we need to make sure that we remove all empty (NA) entries
penguin_adelie_stats <- penguins |>                                    # <2>
  filter(                                                              # <3>
    !is.na(bill_length_mm),
    !is.na(body_mass_g),
    species == "Adelie"
  ) |>                                                                 # <4>
  summarize(
    avg_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm),
    # centroid_mass() calculates the centroid mass (see discussion),   # <5>
    # and is defined in R/centroids.R
    centroid_body_mass = centroid_mass(body_mass_g),
    .by = island
  )
```
1. Clear comment, explains the purpose of the code
2. Verbose, self-documenting variable name
3. Each function call on a separate line, grouped by consitent indentation
4. Use pipe operator to chain transformations
5. Custom function defined in an external script, with a guiding comment

#  AI Usage Guidelines

## General Principles

- **Transparency**: Always disclose AI usage in your work
- **Responsibility**: You are responsible for all content, even if AI-assisted
- **Learning Focus**: Use AI as a tool to enhance learning, not replace it

## Suggested Best Practices

- Use AI for brainstorming
- Ask AI to explain concepts you don't understand
- Have AI review your work for clarity and structure
- Avoid using AI to generate complete solutions without understanding

# Extra Tips and Tricks
<!-- TODOs: VSCode setup for Quarto/RMarkdown etc. -->
## VS Code Setup for Quarto

- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), [R](https://cran.r-project.org) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
- Open VS Code, go to Extensions and install **Quarto**.
- Install the required packages: knitr and rmarkdown. To do this, run the following commands:
  ```
  install.packages('knitr')
  install.packages('rmarkdown')
  ```
  You can run these commands on RStudio ([installation instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)). Alternatively, you can set up an R terminal on VS Code. To do this, you will need another **extension**: **R**. Once you've installed R on VS Code, you can run an R terminal and install packages there.

- To preview your document, press the preview button (top right corner).

- To view recent changes, refresh the preview (refresh button in Quarto Preview tab).
